        <p>This is a sort of jotter pad. At the same time a typing practice lession (i have been up till now a strictly two finger/staring at the key board typist) it is the only way to record anything I read that I want to share with anyone else. Rongorongo script will be decyphered long before my hand writting ever will.</p>

                <p>To Steel or not to Steal ? I want to build everything from the ground up and know that learning the fundamentals will be vital to my progress but whilst I feel that copy-pasting is cheating, I can't help thinking that grabbing advanced technology and retro-engineering it can help.</p>

                <h3>Internal concensus mechanism</h3>
                <p>I love the idea of the entire group of stakeholders owning responsibility for, and benefiting from the actions of the enterprise. No boss as such but rather an agile, spoke-like structure where members work flexibly on multiple projects and are rewarded for contributions to the undertaking commensurately.  </p>

                <p>How "Sapiens" could, or will evolve in relation to advanced information/intelligence technology. Jess and Joseph this sounds like your bag. Should we be scared or excited ? Some organisms have been growing, competing and flourishing alongside new differently adapted competition for quite sometime; Some have fallen by the wayside. </p>

                <p>Or have I just turned into "that guy" that I thought i would never be? Can 1993 really be "The end of history and the last man" I mean "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 chambers)" of course not that silly Fukuyama business.</p> <p>"Raw I'm gonna give it to you, with no trivia Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation like the Emancipation Proclamation Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead you might as well run into the

                <p>Instead of occupying Wall st. can we really just create our own new one. Can distributed verifiable transparent and free records of everything lead to <a href="#"><abbr title='Mutually insured satisfaction stupid'>mass </abbr></a> emancipation from wage slavery and usher in a new era of holacracy? If so do we all want it? or will system justification theorists continue to rule the roost?</p>
