                <h3>Mindfulness v Self awareness.</h3>
                <p>Danny and Jonnie. My new buddies. Maybe they just don’t know it yet. Might not even be buddies themselves. They sound the same to me. Both statements refer to a similar, if not the same, state. An oxymoronic sounding: relaxed alertness,
                    calm activity, or an unexpectant anticipation. Knowing yourself, and finding a comfortable balance between: a healthy admiration of your identity, strengths and talents; and a realization of: your own deficiencies, faults and weaknesses,
                    can be your strongest experiential correlation tool.</p>

                <h3>Self awareness practice.</h3>
                <p>Body scan is something I cheat can at, or at least I'm familiar with . I didn’t know it was a thing. I do it a bit un/sub/consciously when I want to chill out on a sun lounger or lie down in bed. I’ve a couple of injuries ( nothing heroic
                    I’m afraid ) that I need to take into account. I find that identifying the physical sensations (?) makes it a a bit easier to compartmentalise them and to nullify their influence. Of course it’s a important thing to be aware of: the
                    ‘cause and effect’ of an environment on a physical body, and no better way than to dissociate the mind(fullness) from it than by a methodical recognition of it’s parts. Bloody relaxing as well … in a Zen way.</p>

                <h3>Emotions .. not me.</h3>
                <p>I wonder if a subtle change in our language could help us here a little bit. In French, as in loads of other languages I guess, we ‘are’ not an age for example but rather we ‘have ‘ age. I imagine thinking therefore, that I ‘have’ : anger,
                    sadness or inappropriately wild joy after finding the missing semi-colon; not that I ‘am’ any of these emotions. Bearing this in mind I can train myself to ‘not have’ them too. I remain the same. Whoo hoo ! . A quantum mechanic might
                    disagree of course but then you can’t please all the people all the time.</p>
