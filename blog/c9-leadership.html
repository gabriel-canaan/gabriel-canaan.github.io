                <h3>Compassionate leadership.</h3>
                <p>I have experienced the whole gambit of leadership styles, from overly friendly and casual through to draconian. I have also been on the other side many times. I’d like to think that I was not the former or the later, though I’m not sure all of my past employees would agree. What is abundantly clear to me is that a firm but fair, and consistent, approach is the one that gets the best results. I have  worked for employers for whom crews would have walked thorough walls, and also for angry shouty ones whose walls were in no danger.</p>

                <h3>multiplying goodness meditation.</h3>
                <p>I am not the best at this meditation business I have to admit. I enjoy the calmness and the clearing of thoughts but if I am honest visualizing goodness as white light emanating from me sounds a little to much like the funny mushrooms of uncle Mengs buddy.</p>

                <h3>SCARF model</h3>
                <p>This scarf sounds more like a noose. Status, certainty and autonomy are not the adjectives that pop out at me coding-wise. Relatedness and fairness maybe swing the scarf back around my neck more comfortably. If there is one thing that I can say has pleasantly surprised me so far with this course it would be how genuinely friendly and proactively helpful the Hihi’s have been. This is a tough assignment but it would be a cold and disheartening place had you not.</p>
