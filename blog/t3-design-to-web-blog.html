                        excessive manipulation (often with only a thumb) proves unwieldy when viewed on a format of reduced size.

                             With this in mind, the trend, almost exclusively, is towards ‘mobile first’. That is to say that the design and the ‘architecture’ of a site is intended, fundamentally, to be fully operative on a viewing portal of 445px. subsequent expansion
                            to tablet or full HD monitor size can reveal the page in it’s full glory, with additional features and images, but the vital information and interactivity must be available immediately on the most commonly used medium.To neglect
                            this seemingly obvious, yet historically underestimated, aspect of design is at one’s peril.

                        In the overarching spirit of community amongst developers, many open source templates, or ‘frameworks’ have been published in the attempt to facilitate the production of high caliber, fully functioning web experiences. Whether this is purely altruistic
                        behavior, or nefarious ulterior motivation to avoid ugly Internet engagements is debatable. Notwithstanding, frameworks provide a 'pret a porter' kit-set webpage for you to add your own content. Ikeaweb.

                            The ‘blueprint’ for a page/site is referred to as a Wire-frame. It designates the lay out of a site in terms of the position and order of the elements that will be presented. It is the first step in the development process and precedes design considerations.

                    I'm putting this bit at the bottom not only because it was last question and it obviously relates to the images below, but also because I didn't want to muck up the layout above. It took ages, and several minor (major) catastrophies to get it to be responsive.
                    I'm sure I'll disavow any knowledge of having coded it in a few weeks (fingers crossed). Not elegant !. So to answer the question finally, it was trying to impliment the changes when reducing the size of screen. Or more accurately
                    to get the features to align in order and collapse as they were bloody told.
