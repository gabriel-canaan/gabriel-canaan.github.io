                <h3>( )</h3>
                <p>Parentheses can be used to identify a group of operations and to ensure that they are completed before additional operations occur. They are also used to execute  a function and to define it’s parameters.</p>

                <h3>[ ]</h3>
                <p>Brackets are used to enclose a list of items in an ‘Array’ and also to obtain information from those items.</p>

                <h3>{ }</h3>
                <p>Braces are used to define an 'object' and they are employed to deliniate the boundries of a section of code i.e the begining and end of a function.</p>

                <h3>' ' or " "</h3>
                <p>Single and double quotes can be used to describe a ‘string’ that is an item that is not a number such as a word ( a name for example ). Either can be used so long as they are used consistently. As a closing quotation mark signifies the end of a string a word that contains an apostrophe will prematurely end a sting if one has been used to begin. The use of a double quote to open and close means that a single can be employed between them without disruption.</p>
