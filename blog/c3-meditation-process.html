                        Oups .. I read the first few chapters last week and used chapter two as a basis for lot of my last blog. I guess that means I was enjoying it. In the past I have been a bit skeptical of the claims of ‘meditators’ mainly because of their propensity to
                        write throwaway self-help books full of ‘fake news!’. On the other hand the idea of being still an having a calm mind has always appealed to me.

                        The concept of ‘training’ your mind to seems a bit obvious when you think about it; but the idea that rectifying your ‘mistakes’ in the form of readjustments, when your mind wanders off, will strengthen and build your mental core was a new one to me.
                        Very encouraging as well, as I can honestly give myself an A+ for wandering.

                        The concentrating on breathing seems to the place to start and working on posture. Unfortunately I won’t be adopting full lotus anytime soon. Identifying distractions, acknowledging them and letting them move off, combined with mindfully ‘creating space
                        between stimulus and reaction’ would be the next step.

                        I read once that a technique to develop clarity was to imagine a pure white square and to hold it in the minds eye, trying to keep it there unchanging. Ha ! You can probably guess how well thats working out. White square .. easy (doh start again) fuzzy
                        not square not white hey this isn’t so bad whats for lunch how long have I been doing this for don’t want to slip into ‘restaurant mode’ need to try harder maybe be the lady from Udacity would be good at imagining boxes …… oups
                        no square for quite some time now. Back to breathing.

                    <p> I left this bit till last.In a way, to see whether anything would change over the course of the week; in another, to give myself time to come up with a whitty riff along the lines of 'Process NOT product'. Which is self-evidently the
                        path I've found myself on. Nothing so far.<br>So ..., I'll just mention that I would be happy to take any credit for my supposedly principled and dogmatic adhearance to virtues of html over css, but in reality the fact is I deparately
                        need a P.A. with years of Photoshop experience. On a sort of zero contract voluntary type basis... very prestigious.
