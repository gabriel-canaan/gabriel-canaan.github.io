                <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
                <p>I am generally fairly pragmatic and have an ‘innocent until proven guilty’ approach to new relationships. I suppose coming from a hospo background enforces this mindset to an extent due to the transient nature of the people you end up working with. As a result I tend to take people at their face value and don’t have issues with bestowing trust initially. One of my faults is probably the fact that I withdraw it a bit too quickly when I feel that it has been misplaced.</p>

                <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
                <p>I had a great chance to give this a go on the weekend. I spent a good hour or so listening to a guest at a dinner party we had. This gentleman was the the partner of  a work colleague of my wife’s.  He was from Auckland, via England. Wellington was not as balmy as his home country ( ?? ) and was apparently seriously offended by Wellingtonians appreciation of our city. In his eyes, praising Wellington was in effect denouncing Auckland. I am still not sure why. It was however, intriguing to keep Mr Meng’s insights in mind while I tried to understand his viewpoint.</p>

                <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
                <p>I love kindness, so this was an easy addition to my meditation regime. It is easy for me to see that positive thinking can go a long way towards achieving positive results. </p>
