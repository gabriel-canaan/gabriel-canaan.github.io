                <p>
                    Row's and columns are what it's all about on a webpage.It's straight forward cartesian axis of 12 vertical divisions and any number of horizontal ones that define where on a page different elements are placed.

                    <h3>Responsive webpages ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly websites are being viewed on a variety of devices.Not just the desktop of yesteryear but tablets,phlablets and of course the ubiquitous smartphone. Web design that worked so well on a full screen was soon recognised to be less than ideal
                        on one a fraction of the size. Rather than design multiple sites, methods are now implimented whereby a sites layout and features automatically modify and compensate for different viewing portal options.

                        <h3>Semantic structure</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order for a web browser to interpret the instructions and display the elements of a pages design, certain nomenclatureal forms must be observed. For reasons of brevity and clariety it is not correct to simply designate a phrase 'Big' then assign it a large font size. One would instead for example utilize an h1 tag, recognisable by a browser as a heading of a certain size.

                                The facinating challanges that arise whilst attempting to replicate something that has worked previously or has been seen to work in other cases. A f*$?%!# box for example, yes that one to the left, that inexplicably and infuriatingly demonstrate aberant
                                behaviour.
