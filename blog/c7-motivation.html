  <h2>Pursuing happiness (c'mere damit)</h2>

                <h3>Pleasure</h3>
                <p>While initially the life of a rock star appears to be a non-stop hedonistic one way journey through the pleasure dome; but I think that for most, there are more than enough cautionary tales to convince us that this is not a sustainable lifestyle. Nor one that we would really welcome. Aspects, now and then would most certainly be appreciated ! However the tendency to become acclimatised and then inured to the highs appears to create a preponderance of lows. It is no surprise that the literature addressing the abuse of narcotics utilizes identical language. The fix soon becomes insufficient and increasingly higher dosages never seem to be enough. This does not sound like happiness !</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h3>Passion</h3>
                <p>Conversely, a consistent/persistent level of happiness achieved by doing what you enjoy or enjoying  what you do, to be more realistic for the majority, sounds more attractive ( at least to me ). Pursuing a goal of a high level of happiness through identifying and aligning yourself with a lifestyle, and this almost certainly encompasses your professional role(s) , that you both feel good about, and are willing to excel in, can provide greater satisfaction ( yes mick , you can get it) than a futile chase for  ephemeral gratification. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>To have a purpose behind, and in fact underneath, your endeavors can lead to yet another level of the happiness that we tend to seek. The knowledge that our actions are beneficial to not only ourselves but to others brings with it a multitude of bonuses.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h3>Integrity.</h3>
                <p>Doing what you say. Simple. I expect others to do this and I try to do it all the time. I am nowhere nearly as good at this as I wish I was , but as I know how much it winds me up when people don’t, I have a great motivation to do so.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h3>Directness.</h3>
                <p>Saying what you think . Diplomacy is necessary and admirable but detrimental when masking an important issue. I’m not so bad at this one (oups, did I say that out loud). There are of course times and places for different types of conversations but repressing a problem makes it harder to fix, in my opinion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h3>Loyalty,</h3>
                <p>Not as a  blinkered and uncritical following (except for the glorious Chelsea); but rather as an unwavering support and help for what I think is right and the expectation that I will receive this  also. Fostering an ‘esprit de corp’ and creating  synergistic relationships strike me as the best ways to achieve goals for all concerned.</p>

                <h3>Freedom.</h3>
                <p>In a freedom of speech ‘do what you want as long as you're not stopping anyone else doing what they want’ kind of way. Not a ‘dirty fed's trin’ to steal my gunz’ kind of way.  Oppression/repression, politically, militarily and and economically, is to me demonstratively detrimental to the whole world. </p>

                <h3>Resilience.</h3>
                <p>I just love the word, it’s sonorous. There’s something about s’ and l’ that just sound good together. Apparently cats like it too. The idea that failure can lead to success, and in fact sometimes be integral to that success, is a great comfort to me at the moment( looks like I am well on the way to becoming a world class ninja). Accepting that obstacles, blocks and even outright mistakes are not a cause for despair but can instead be used as tools for improvement can lead to ultimately  successful completion.</p>

                <h3>Musing</h3>
                <p>I know I keep banging on about it, but I feel that cryptocurriencies and the blockchain technology that underpin them could be a force that begins the process of recalibrating our socio-economy and offering a real chance to enrich all the world's populous ( not just us hummies either ).
