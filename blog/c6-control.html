                    <p>They look worried eh ?</p>
                    <p>To begin with, my first and major; is that I am hyper aware that I’m not an office ( generic term for != manual labour ) person. I’ve never worked in or spent time in an environment where I have used a computer to any great extent.
                        Certainly not for anything serious. As a result I find myself quickly thinking that I am somehow at a disadvantage ‘poor me poor me’. In fact pretty much all of my negative triggers are ‘children’ of this. Typing speed and unfamiliarity
                        with keyboard/mouse are a minor example (not the end of the world and I am working on it). I notice it straight away, which is good and so reflecting and then responding helps me back on track. </p>

                    <h3>keep cool</h3>
                    <p>Like a big block of ice on a moterbike</p>
                    <p> The section on triggers reminded me of times when I was running a restaurant or Bar and I had problematic staff to deal with. After a few incidents they became ‘boxed’ or ‘tagged’ in my mind and the smallest mistake or issue ( “food
                        poisoning’’ just before brunch service after Saturday nights big party ??? hmmm) would drive me crazy. A nice cool train ride would have done me good. A one way to Siberia for them as well perhaps .</p>
