                          HTML CSS and JS <br>An analogy I use to explain the roles of JS, HTML and CSS to my wife is that of her business’s function at the All Blacks test matches. She stage manages the event.<br> The rugby itself is the HTML, that is to say 15
                        v 15 players, one ball, and the order of the game ( kick off, half-time etc.)<br> CSS could be the colours of the teams uniforms , the sponsors logo’s painted on the pitch, the big screen (sort of JS-ish but for arguments sake an image
                        of sorts ) and a pitch of certain dimension (border-box ?).<br> Java Script is what she does. Which is to say, the timing of the event to coordinate with sky sports internationally: the pre-match entertainment, the National anthems,
                        the giant team jersey that passes through the stands and onto the field (and of again on time), the pyrotechnics (don’t set fire to the grass !) and all the dynamic enhancements.

                           Control flow and Loops<br> When I wake up, after showering and getting dressed I make some breakfast and sit down to read the news.<br> myRoutine goes like this:<br> (IF) I check my notifications for the Chelsea logo (if we have played or
                            signed another player it will pop up) and if it’s there I will open my Chelsea news app and revel in our resent triumphant victory.<br> (ELSE IF) If there’s nothing showing I’ll open up the Guardian and scan for fascinating Trumpisms
                            and read them. <br>(ELSE IF) If nothing grabs me I’ll then open up Stuff, Al Jazeera, BBC , Russia today, Reuters, Huffington post etc. and do the same.<br> (ELSE) If I haven’t been hooked I’ll go back to the Guardian and start to
                            read through all the articles that interest me or I think are important. The whole time I have a nagging feeling that whilst I believe that it’s important to keep up with whats going on ....<br> (WHILE) So, until I begin to feel
                            too guilty about not doing my homework I’ll continue through the rest of the papers avoiding only the stuff about celebrities ,royals and horse racing. <br>(BREAK) The routine (LOOP) is now finished and I devote myself unreservedly
                            to codecademy... (cue maniacal laughter: ah ha ha ha ha hah ahhha haaaaa !)

                        Accessing info from Arrays and Ojects <br> Listing items as arrays or objects seems ,superficially, to be quite similar. I’m sure we will encounter the real differences soon (hope so). What is evidently different is the way we can access the data in these
                        ‘lists’. To obtain information from an array we identify is position in the ‘list’, that is from first [0] to last [nth] and that item can be displayed. An object, as it has properties associated with it, when ‘called’ by it’s
                        name will display it’s attributions.

                            How useful are functions right ?<br> A Function is a bit like a mini program. A certain number of commands are initiated when various criteria are meet. Once defined it can be run again and again without the need to re write, saving the poor coder
                            from RSI. and can be call(ed) upon at any time by entering fresh data.
