                    <p>Listening.<br>
                      I have had a great opportunity to practice mindful listening this weekend as I have taken some friends up to the tropical KC. They have spent two months traveling around the south island and have had a truly wonderful experience. They have so many tales to tell of their trip and also of news/gossip from home to share with my wife, as she spent a few years over there.<br>
  I didn’t let them in on the fact that I was doing it to begin with to be fair but I’m sure they wouldn’t have minded. It was interesting to watch the dynamic of the three of them all trying to share their thoughts simultaneously. In an innocent and non competitive way to be sure, but still I wondered how much information was lost as the conversation skipped and jumped to one subject to another. Some threads followed and some potentially fascinating ones lost entirely.<br> Afterwards I practiced in earnest with da missus for the three minutes and after a brief feeling of self consciousness we really enjoyed it.

                        <p>Walking.<br>
                    I also had the luxury of Waikanae beach to practice mindful walking. I walk a lot. In fact I decided  at age 15 not to ever have credit cards or car keys. So I walk a lot.<br>Back in the day I read about a group of Zen monks in japan who practiced walking meditation (as well as gravel raking) and the aim was to reach a stage where there was no differentiation between the monk, the path or anything else really. There was just ‘walking’. I have always remembered that and am glad that it’s now part of my homework.<br> I generally spend my walking time to gather my thoughts and mull over things ( as well as being mindful of pesky distractions like traffic ) but this week I have had a good crack at not thinking. Instead of concentrating on just breathing I used the sound of the waves which is probably cheating but hey use it or lose it right ?
