                <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                <p> Pseudo-code is an absolute must for me. I am not yet au fait with the language structures of programing to an extent that I can just just jump in. I need to explain to myself first what I envisage happening.</p>

                <h3>Trying something</h3>
                <p>DIY is at the foundation of everything I do at the moment code-wise. Not always with success of course (percentages are low). I love mucking about with code to try to get something to work and thankfully have a new best friend in ctrl
                    + z.</p>

                <h3><rp>Rubber ducky</rp></h3>
                <p>I have an imaginary duck ( honest ). I hope that no one can hear me ( yes you NSA ) because I probably sound a bit unhinged, ranting away to no one about semi-colons and stuff.<br> It works though , breaking a problem down, re-organising
                    it, so often solves things all by themselves.</p>

                <h3>Console logging</h3>
                <p>I have to admit that amongst the many JS weakness’ I have is the ability to utilize the console.log effectively. It is something (not the only, haha) that I will be working on in the future. It's not the same thing I know but I do like
                    JS bin.</p>

                <h3>Googling</h3>
                <p>Asking uncle Google has become second nature for so many people, myself included. I really miss looking something up in encyclopedia Britannica but have to admit that the former is a lot easier. I was impressed by Josephs take on the wholesale
                    over usage of others code as being not beneficial to learning, but that judicial appropriation can be in everyones interest. Getting over the nagging feeling that you are cheating by accessing others work is going to imperative in
                    the near future.</p>

                <h3>Asking peers/coaches for help</h3>
                <p>A two for one answer here as I feel they are not mutually exclusive. Although I have not had a lot of direct contact with any coaches I feel that everyone at EDA is super approachable in the same way that I have noticed the Hihi’s being.
                    My little hang up is not wanting to : a) bother people, and b) look like a numpty for not instantly grasping strange new concepts. I try to get over this by reminding myself how long it took me to get by in France and how I still speak
                    like a Spanish cow. </p>

                <h3>Process of reflection</h3>
                <p>Reflection is another area I need to work on. I am finding that I must be overly focused on results and not nearly aware enough of the procedure employed to achieve them. Doh ! </p>

                <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                <p>At first error messages looked like some long extinct and untranslatable hieroglyphics …. still does.</p>

                <h3>Place holder</h3>
                <p>Just when I thought bootstrap was my new best friend ... If I don't put anything here all the rest of the boxes get all out of wack.Cry. <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>

                <h3>Map</h3>
                <p>Map is similar to a copy of of a list, but one that has been subjected to specified changes. The original remain unchanged but the mapped copy will feature the modifications i.e. 1,2,3 times two will be mapped to 2,4,6 .</p>

                <h3>Filter</h3>
                <p>Filter is not dissimilar to a map in that it returns a copy of an original list. It’s difference lies in the fact that it returns only the item that pass a certain criteria. A list of numbers from one to one hundred could be ‘filtered’
                    to only return even numbers for example.</p>

                <h3>Reduce</h3>
                <p>Reduce is a bit like stock. You chuck loads of stuff in a big pot of water and boil the crap out of it. At the end you have stock, all the initial ingredients are still there (the goodness anyway) but you have a unique product. It looks
                    similar to just adding up but there’s a lot more going on.</p>
