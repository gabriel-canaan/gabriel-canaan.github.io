                <p>My initial impressions of Dev academy are all really positive. After listening to the fire side chat and of course speaking with Rohan,Rupert,Joseph and a few Hihi's my feeling is that It's going to be a fantastic experience.</p>

                <p>I'm definitly in the "intimidated by everyone elses previous knowledge" catergory, not the "I'm to cool for school" one. So it's important to know that it's not just me who starts out that way.</p>
                <p>The inclusive and colaborative culture will be of great comfort to me as I try to lose my "fish out of water" mindset. Learning to expose ignorance is something I will need to work on because although I concider myself fairly outgoing
                    and not shy, I guess I an a bit introverted when it comes to showing weakness i.e. asking for help. I have a bit of a D.I.Y attitude and will try to muddle through myself (not always with great success). Please feel free to let me
                    know if you find me reverting to type. Cheers.</p>

                <p>I enjoyed the Restaurant vs Kitchen analogy Karim used regarding adopting a 'roll your sleves up and pitch in together to produce something amazing' attitude,rather than a 'I just payed a fortune where's my certificate?!' one; and this
                    is despite the fact that although I love cooking I have always been a front of house guy. The kichen has always looked crazy to me (sorry chef).</p>

                <p>To round up I think I have (hopefully) a reasonably healthy excited versus apprehensive balance. Enough to know that it's going to be bloody hard yakka, that I am really! far out of my comfort zone but that I have a few skills and experiences
                    that (again hopefully) that will be of use to pairs I will be in, and to the cohort in general.</p>
