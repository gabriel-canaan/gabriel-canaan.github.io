       <p>I have been using the pomodoro system</p>
  <p>I have been pleasantly surprised about how it worked to be honest.
    I hope that doesn't sound cynical but I've always worked jobs where asking for a break was tantamount to heresy.</p>
   <p>I find pomodoro to work really well, and I need it. The alarm function is great ... times up ! off you go ! have: a wander, play with the cat, have a snack ... come back fresh and go hard.</p>
  <p>I will look at any and all new techniques, maybe you need to take a break from pomodoro too?   oooh too soon  ... ? Time boxing is going to be a major for me so I'm all ears for suggestions that work for others. </p>
