            I am really enjoying the writing style of S.I.Y.and it's sense of playfulness. Self-help books tend to be very earnest, a bit too much for me. I like that Mr Meng regards this process as a scientific, measurable and demonstrative. Maybe I should have
            been an engineer too.<br> I think the analogy of gym training, with a desired result of producing better functioning equipment (brain and emotional rather than muscular) that anyone can benefit from, and taylor to themselves is
            very powerful. It is obvious immediately that this sort of mental fitness and empathetic mindset would be invaluble in the field we are all looking to be a part of, not to mention life in general.

            I have been trying out the ‘easy way’ two minute session with mixed results. I enjoy it and find it usuful to have a litle micro break but instead of Mr M’s commonly reported issue of vearing off track with thoughts of worthlessness, ‘I’m crap at this’,
            ‘this won’t work for me” etc. I find myself cogratulating myself; ‘hey I’m meditating, this is great’, ‘ not thinking about anything ‘, ‘mind as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer’ ‘I’m think ..... oh bollocks ! ‘ . Start again .. breathe
            in.
